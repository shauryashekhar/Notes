# Notes

Just a collection of notes on various technologies that I've learnt.

1. Multithreading in Java -> Runnable (run()) vs Callable (call()) -> ExecutorService

2. Java JDBC -> DeviceManager -> Connection -> Statement / PreparedStatement -> executeQuery() / executeUpdate()

3. Exception Handling -> try/ catch/ finally -> Exceptions vs RunTime Exceptions -> Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions. - throws vs try catch.
