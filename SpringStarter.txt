Spring Starter:

Spring is mainly used for:-
	1. Inversion of Control - generation and management of beans
	2. Dependency Injection - injecting the dependencies of beans
	
	
XML Configuration:-
	1. Create applicationContext.xml in src directory.
	2. Declare <bean> inside this xml file
	3. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml") in java file to import the xml
	4. getBean() from context (defined above).
	5. Once you get the bean we can use it to call functions.
	
	Structure of bean definition:-
	
	<bean id = "name used to call bean in getBean()" class = "class whose bean this is to be">
		<scope = "prototype/ singleton"> {if prototype, every time new object is declared, you will get new object, if singleton, one object will be reused}
		
	</bean>
	
	For dependency injection:-
	
	This can be achieved in two different ways:
		1. Through constructor injection:-
			
		2. Through setter methods
